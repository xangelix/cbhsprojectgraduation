Thank you to the Cocoa Beach Elks lodge for sponsoring Project Graduation!

### Who Are the Elks?

Elks Lodges bring so much more to their communities than just a building, golf course or pool. They are places where neighbors come together, families share meals, and children grow up.

Elks invest in their communities through programs that help children grow up healthy and drug-free, meet the needs of todayâ€™s veterans, and improve the quality of life.
