 You’ve been FLOCKED by CBHS Project Graduation!
We need your support! If you walked outside to a yard infested with flamingos,
NEVER FEAR, we have a few solutions for you!
For a $20 donation you can send your flock packing. For a $25 donation you can choose whose yard they will infest next! Flock as many friends as you’d like! For the low price of $30 you can purchase FLOCKING INSURANCE to guarantee provide protection against any future flamingo infestation!</description>
