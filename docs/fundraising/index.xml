      <description>Congratulations!
You’ve been FLOCKED by CBHS Project Graduation!
If you walked outside to a yard infested with flamingos,
NEVER FEAR, we have a few solutions for you!
For a $20 donation you can send your flock packing.
For a $25 donation you can choose whose yard the flock will infest next!
For just $30 you can purchase FLOCKING INSURANCE to guarantee provide protection against any future flamingo infestation!

Do nothing and the flock will migrate after 48 hours.</description>
